# Modern Data Stack – Prerequisites and Roadmap

## Local Prerequisites

To successfully run this stack using `deploy-bulletproof.sh`, ensure the following tools are installed and configured:

### Required Software

| Tool              | Minimum Version | Notes                                     |
|-------------------|------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Docker            | 20.10+           | Make sure Docker Engine is running        |
| Docker Compose    | v2+              | Required for orchestration                |
| Git (optional)    | Any              | For cloning and versioning the repo       |
| Bash              | 4.x+             | Required to run the deployment script     |
| cURL              | Any              | Used for health checks in some services   |

### Compatible Environments

- **macOS (Apple Silicon ARM64)** – Fully supported

## Roadmap and Future Improvements

This stack is for local development, but several enhancements are planned for future versions:

### Technical Enhancements

- Add **automatic DAG bootstrap** in Airflow using init container or scripts
- Include **Prometheus + Grafana** for metrics, logging, and observability
- Harden secrets with **Docker secrets** or **Vault integration**
- Pre-configure **Flink jobs** and **Kafka topic templates**
- Add **SQLMesh model repo bootstrap** in `sqlmesh/` directory
- Optional **GPU support** for ML workloads in Jupyter or external models

### Developer Features

- UI-based service health dashboard (e.g., Dash or Flask)
- Integrate **Superset** as an alternative BI layer
- Add **Great Expectations** or **Soda** for data quality checks
- Support **OpenLineage** or **Marquez** for data lineage tracking

### Deployment Targets

- Add **Kubernetes manifests** or Helm chart generator for cloud-native deployment
- Enable **GitHub Actions** CI/CD workflow for push-to-deploy experience
- Optional **Terraform module** for AWS or GCP-native equivalents

## Getting Started

After verifying your machine has the required tools, run:

```bash
chmod +x deploy-bulletproof.sh
./deploy-bulletproof.sh
docker-compose up -d
```

All components will be deployed with volumes and health checks for stability.

This stack is built for fast prototyping, real-world pipelines, and full-stack analytics. Future iterations will expand into scalable cloud-native territory.
